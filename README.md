# Project 5:  Map App

This map will center on the user's position (if geolocation is enabled),
and will display a marker with a small circle showing their approximate 
location. Markers are then placed in select liquor stores in the Eugene 
area. The names and addresses are stored on a file on the server, read into the 
flask application, which handles an ajax request and returns json to the client
in order to place the markers on their map.
